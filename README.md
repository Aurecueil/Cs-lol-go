# Updates
cslol-go automatically checks for the latest version when you open the app. If there is a newer version, the app will display a message box.

To update: download the latest release from GitHub and extract it to the same location (overwriting existing files).

# Usage
## Mod Tiles
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/Aurecueil/Temp/blob/main/images/modtile.png"/>
</p>

To enable a mod, check its checkmark on the left.

The buttons on a mod tile are as follows (left to right):
1. Topaz mod fixer
1. Export
1. Edit
1. Delete

## Search
Filter your installed mods. You can use the following flags to better filter search results.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These flags **must** be at the very start of the search query.

- `-g` (global) to show ALL installed mods
- `-f` (flat) to show ALL mods for current mods (lol/tft)
- `-l` (local) to show all mods in current folder and subfolders (recursive)

### Other search options

> [!TIP]
> These keywords can be *anywhere* in the search query, and can be partial (`author:` / `auth:` / `a:`)

- `name:` e.g. `n:Spirit Blossom`
- `author:` e.g. `a:moga`
- `wad:` e.g `w:aurora`

Logic Statements:
- `||` OR statement, e.g. `Briar || Zoe`

## CLI
While the app is running, you can call the executable again with flags, to execute specific actions.

> [!TIP]
> This will bring the app to front.

Actions are executed in a fixed order, the order of the flags do not affect execution order.
- `--start` to start the mod loader
- `--sp` to switch the currently selected profile
- `--stop` to stop the mod loader
- `--dbu` to prevent the app from being brought to front
